\hypertarget{multiple-inheritance}{%
\subsection{Multiple Inheritance}\label{multiple-inheritance}}

Multiple inheritance works fine when you combine classes that have
nothing in common, but there is a conflict if these classes have common
attributes or methods.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
class Student { def id: String = ... }
class Employee { def id: String = ... }
class MSEPartTimeStudent extends Student, Employee { ... }
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{problem-of-name-clashes}{%
\subsubsection{Problem of name clashes}\label{problem-of-name-clashes}}

If you have different methods with the same name, but different meaning,
you will also have a conflict in Java. C\# is able to solve this by
defining the class from which the method is derived.\\
\textit{draw from the cowboy means ``ziehen'' in the meaning of draw his
revolver.}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/nameClash.png}
\caption{Name clashes}
\end{figure}

This is even more complicated if the methods are not abstract, but they
have content and inherit different different content.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
public interface B {
    default int getValue() { return 1; }
}
public interface C {
    default int getValue() { return 2; }
}
public class D implements B, C {
    public int getValue() {
        return C.super.getValue();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

To avoid conflicts, the class D needs to override the method
\texttt{getValue()} and call the method of the mother class.

\hypertarget{example-in-c}{%
\subsubsection{Example in C}\label{example-in-c}}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,mathescape=false]
class A {
    public: int id;
    public: A() { id = 0; }
};
class B1 : public A {
    public: B1() { id = 1; }
};
class B2 : public A {
    public: B2() { id = 2; }
}
class C : public B1, public B2 {};
    static int main(void*) {
    C* c = new C();
    cout << dynamic_cast<B1*>(c) -> id << endl;
    cout << dynamic_cast<B2*>(c) -> id << endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

This example shows the multiple inheritance from C. In C, the full
content of the classes which I inherit from is copied to the target
class. So if I inherit from two classes, I have two full content of
these two classes. With this behaviour, the code above prints 0012
(because of the dynamic binding).

\subsubsection{Java solution from Java}\label{java-solution-from-java}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Single implementation inheritance
\item
  Multiple interface inheritance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No solution to the naming problem: If two interfaces introduce
    methods with the same name and signature but of different return
    type, then no class can simultaneously implement both interfaces
  \item
    Inherited default implementation must be resolved explicitly
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{traits-in-scala}{%
\subsection{Traits in Scala}\label{traits-in-scala}}

Scala traits provide a mixin composition mechanism that has been missing
in Java. Roughly speaking, you can think of traits as analogous to Java
interfaces, but with implementations and fields and dynamic composition.

Traits can be seen as a solution to the

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Diamond problem or
\item
  Linearization Problem
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=110px]{figures/diamondProblem.png}
\caption{Diamond Problem}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traits encapsulate method and field definitions
\item
  Traits can be reused by mixing them into classes
\item
  Traits define a type (comparable to a Java interface)
\item
  Traits cannot be instantiated, they are abstract, but they can be used
  in all contexts where other abstract classes appear
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\subsubsection{Definitions}\label{definitions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Like class definitions, except that they use the keyword trait
\item
  Traits have no constructor parameters and do not support auxiliary
  constructors
\item
  Traits can be extended from other traits or from classes
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/exampleTrait.png}
\caption{Example Trait}
\end{figure}

The code word \texttt{with} defines a union type. This means, this is a
valid type. If you want to have a combination of two types, you don't
have to create an interface of this two types, you can just use
\texttt{with}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
class ConsoleLogger extends Logger with Serializable with Cloneable {
    override def log(msg: String) { println(msg) }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{trais-with-implementation}{%
\paragraph{Trais with implementation}\label{trais-with-implementation}}

Traits can alos have concrete implementations.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
trait ConsoleLogger {
    def log(msg: String) { println(msg) }
}
class DebitAccount extends Account with ConsoleLogger {
    def withdraw(amount: Double) {
        log(s"withdraw($amount) called")
        balance -= amount
    }
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

This methods can also be overriden.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
trait ConsoleLogger {
    def log(msg: String) { println(msg) }
}
class DebitAccount extends Account with ConsoleLogger {
    def withdraw(amount: Double) {
        log(s"withdraw($amount) called")
        balance -= amount
    }
    override def log(msg: String) {
        super.log("DebitAccount."+msg)
    }
    ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{traits-on-objects}{%
\paragraph{Traits on objects}\label{traits-on-objects}}

Traits can be added on object at creation time

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
trait Logger {
    def log(msg: String) { }
}
trait ConsoleLogger extends Logger {
    override def log(msg: String) { println(msg) }
}
class DebitAccount extends Account with Logger {
    def withdraw(amount: Double) {
        log(s"withdraw($amount) called")
        balance -= amount
    }
    ...
}

val a0 = new DebitAccount //Nothing is logged as default logger is used
val a1 = new DebitAccount with ConsoleLogger //On a1, console logger is used for logging
val a2 = new DebitAccount with FileLogger //On a2, a file logger is used
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{extending-interfaces}{%
\subsubsection{Extending Interfaces}\label{extending-interfaces}}

Traits can have utility methods which depend on a few abstract methods
which are provided by the class in which the trait is mixed in. Traits
can also be used to extend the functionality of an interface.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A class (may be a trait) defines a thin interface which is implemented
  by concrete extensions
\item
  A trait defines additional functionality which may be mixed in
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
trait Logger {
    def log(msg: String) // abstract
    def info(msg: String) { log("INFO: " + msg) }
    def warn(msg: String) { log("WARN: " + msg) }
    def error(msg: String) { log("ERROR: " + msg) }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage
\hypertarget{stackable-modifications}{%
\subsubsection{Stackable Modifications}\label{stackable-modifications}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traits can be used to modify the behavior, comparable to the decorator
  design pattern
\item
  In contrast to the decorator, traits are mixed in statically and not
  at run-time

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    in a class
  \item
    when instances are created
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A particular trait cannot be mixed in several times

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    no repeated modifications
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In contrast to the decorator the modified class inherits the types of
  the unmodified class!
\item
  Example

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Timestamp Logger: adds a time stamp
  \item
    Short Logger: shortens the messages
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
//Timestamp Logger
trait TimestampLogger extends Logger {
    override def log(msg: String) {
        super.log(s"${new java.util.Date()} $msg")
    }
}

//Short Logger
trait ShortLogger extends Logger {
    override def log(msg: String) {
        super.log(if(msg.length <= 15) msg else msg.substring(0,12)+"...")
    }
}

scala> val a1 = new DebitAccount with ConsoleLogger with TimestampLogger with ShortLogger
scala> val a2 = new DebitAccount with ConsoleLogger with ShortLogger with TimestampLogger

scala> a1.withdraw(100)
Wed Mai 15 22:38:56 CET 2019 withdraw(100...
scala> a2.withdraw(100)
Wed Mai 15 2...
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{super.log} invokes the next trait in the trait hierarchy
\item
  With traits, super calls are dynamically bound, i.e.~you cannot tell
  from the source code of a trait which method is invoked by
  \texttt{super.someMethod}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage
\hypertarget{overriding-abstract-methods-in-traits}{%
\paragraph{Overriding abstract methods in
traits}\label{overriding-abstract-methods-in-traits}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the method in the base trait is abstract, then the overriding
  method in a sub-trait has to be declared both abstract and override
\item
  Abstract override method provides an implementation based on another
  implementation (therefore it is abstract)
\item
  Such an implementation is abstract as it needs a concrete method in a
  class or trait where it can be mixed in
\item
  Supercall still possible but dynamically resolved (invokes provided
  implementation)
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
abstract class IntQueue {
    def get() : Int
    def put(x: Int)
}
class BasicIntQueue extends IntQueue {
    private val buf = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]
    def get() = buf.remove(0) // removes first element
    def put(x: Int) { buf += x } // adds at the end
}

scala> val q = new BasicIntQueue
q: BasicIntQueue = BasicIntQueue@1a6601c
scala> q.put(10); q.put(11);
scala> q.get
res1: Int = 10

//Now with the modificator
trait Doubling extends IntQueue {
    abstract override def put(x: Int) { super.put(2*x); }

trait Incr extends IntQueue {
    abstract override def put(x: Int) { super.put(x+1); }

scala> val q = new BasicIntQueue with Doubling
q: BasicIntQueue with Doubling = $anon$1@d5714b
scala> q.put(10)
scala> q.get
res32: Int = 20

//Additonal example on multiple traits
scala> val q = new BasicIntQueue with Doubling with Incr
q: BasicIntQueue with Doubling with Incr = $anon$1@3b60efd8
scala> q.put(10)
scala> q.get //22

\hypertarget{self-types}{%
\subsubsection{Self Types}\label{self-types}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a trait extends a class C, that class becomes a superclass of any
  class mixing in the trait
\item
  Alternatively one can define the self type to guarantee that the trait
  is mixed in a particular class
\item
  In the trait methods, any methods of the self type can be invoked
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=scala,mathescape=false]
//Name of the self type is irrelevant, could be named self (or ex or ...)
trait ExceptionLogger extends Logger {
    this: Exception =>

\hypertarget{class-linearization}{%
\subsection{Class Linearization}\label{class-linearization}}

\textit{Leading question: In which order are the traits called?}

When an instance of a class C is created with new C, then the class C
and all its inherited classes and traits are put in a \textbf{single,
linear order}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The linear order defines the constructor invocation order (from Any to
  C)
\item
  The linear order defines method lookup priorities, i.e.~it defines,
  which method overrides another method
\item
  The linear order defines which method is called on a super call (it is
  the next in the linear order chain)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{No diamond problems and each class appears only once!}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The inheritance relationship on base classes forms in general a DAG
\item
  A linearization of this graph is defined as follows:

\item
  Put the actual type of the instance as the first element
\item
  Starting with the rightmost parent type and working from right to
  left, compute the linearization of each type, appending its
  linearization to the cumulative linearization
\item
  Working from left to right, remove any type if it appears again to the
  right of the current position
