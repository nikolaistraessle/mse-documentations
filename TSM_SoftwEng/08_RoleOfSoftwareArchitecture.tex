\subsection{What is Software
Architecture}\label{what-is-software-architecture}}

A software system's architecture is the set of principal design
decisions about the system. Software architecture is the blueprint for a
software system's construction and evolution.

\item
  Definition of

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Classes, Hirarchies, etc
  \item

    \item
      Components
    \item
      Relations
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Decisions
  \end{itemize}
\item
  On basis of

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    functional requirements
  \item
    non-functional requirements
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A software architecture provides an overview and supports an easy
understanding. It describes a solution that fits

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  fulfills functional and non-functional requirements
\item
  can be realized (political and organizational)
\item
  can be implemented (e.g.~proof through prototypes)
\end{itemize}

At the end:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  process: design a solution
\item
  product: models, documentation, prototypes
\item
  means: eases implementation of larger system

Architecture: The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its
components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment,
and the principles guiding its design and evolution.

\hypertarget{proving-the-software-architecture}{%
\subsection{Proving the software
architecture}\label{proving-the-software-architecture}}

We only can prove the software architecture by doing some prototypes of
the hardest componenst and prove that it fulfills the requirements.

\hypertarget{documentation}{%
\subsection{Documentation}\label{documentation}}

Software Architecture is a set of models of the overall software system.
All requirements relevant for the system's construction must be
addressed, e.g.~Extendibility Timing Performance Security.

\hypertarget{architectural-views-kruchten}{%
\subsection{Architectural Views
Kruchten}\label{architectural-views-kruchten}}

Different stakeholders need different information. With different views
on the project, you are able to split the different requirements and
extract the proper information for these stakeholders. Kruchten suggests
4+1 views.

\hypertarget{logical-view}{%
\subsubsection{Logical View}\label{logical-view}}

The logical view is concerned with the functionality that the system
provides to end-users.\\
\textit{Class diagram, Communication diagram, Sequence diagram.}

\hypertarget{development-view}{%
\subsubsection{Development View}\label{development-view}}

The development view illustrates a system from a programmer's
perspective and is concerned with software management. This view is also
known as the implementation view.\\
\textit{Package Diagram, UML Component Diagram}

\hypertarget{process-view}{%
\subsubsection{Process View}\label{process-view}}

The process view deals with the dynamic aspects of the system, explains
the system processes and how they communicate, and focuses on the
runtime behavior of the system.. \\
\textit{Activity diagram}

\hypertarget{physical-view}{%
\subsubsection{Physical View}\label{physical-view}}

The physical view depicts the system from a system engineer's
point-of-view. It is concerned with the topology of software components
on the physical layer, as well as communication between these
components. Also the question where to deploy the system\\

\hypertarget{scenarios}{%
\subsubsection{(+1)Scenarios}\label{scenarios}}

The description of an architecture is illustrated using a small set of
use cases, or scenarios which become a fifth view.\\
