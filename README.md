# MSE Documentations

I attended some modules of the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) and created a LaTeX documentation for them. You can fork them and adjust it to your needs. I did the following modules:

- CM_ComplPro
- CM_PrivLaw
- CM_CorpCom
- FTP_CryptCod
- FTP_Optimiz
- FTP_TheoComp
- TSM_EmbReal
- TSM_MobOp
- TSM_AdvPrPa
- TSM_ProgAlg
- TSM_SoftwEng

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that the documentation is tailored to me and may not be complete. Sometimes I used to write the documentation in markdown and converted it to LaTex (using pandoc), which may lead to a mess in the LaTex sources. The final PDF files can be found on www.studentbox.ch.
