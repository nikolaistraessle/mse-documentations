\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Technical Debts are not always negativ and often a reason for a
  project to going forward
\item
  Technical Debts are sometimes needed or useful, e.g.~for a proof of
  concept
\item
  Many times a critical technical debt must be prioritized even if it
  affects a low critical business process, to reduce the problem of
  accumulating debt.

\subsection{Improving Code
Maintainability}\label{improving-code-maintainability}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Problem:} Nowadays a lot of code is not written by former
  educated software developers and therefore this code is not structured
  well and not easy to maintain
\item
  Lessons Learned:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Data Models should be extensible
  \item
    The scientiests need to refactor their software on their own and try
    to consult the software engineers not that much
  \item
    The software engineer should understand the domain
  \item
    Static code analysis should be used early
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Understanding the Role of Reporting in Work Item Tracking
Systems for Software
Development}\label{understanding-the-role-of-reporting-in-work-item-tracking-systems-for-software-development}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Analysis and reporting of issues means that some characteristics of
  existing issues (in the issue-tracking-system) are analysed to create
  reports out of it e.g.~the response time of issues.
\item
  A survey should focus on some key points, should be well designed
  (short and logical) and should be sent to the proper survey
  participants
\item
  The initial effort for the setup and the configuration is quite high
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key questions}\label{key-questions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why should reporting tools be used?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Better project tracking
  \item
    Future planning
  \item
    Work priorization
  \item
    Resource allocation
  \item
    Detect issues
  \item
    Increasing visibility
  \item
    SLA compliance
  \item
    Rewards
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is a typical scenario that you use reporting tools for?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    e.g.~Burndown charts
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What do you get out of using reporting tools?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You are able to classify issues and gain information about the
    dependencies of issues.
  \item
    With the information, you are able to better understand the weight
    and the importance of an issue.
  \item
    You can recognize changes in the software development
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Where and how often do you use reporting tools?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    These methods can be used as part of the agile software development
    sprints, to analyze the progress and take decisions with this
    information.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What tools do you use to create and view reports?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    VSTS Dashboard
  \item
    Power BI Website
  \item
    Microsoft Excel
  \item
    Other
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tools / services that help improve productivity will have more
  adoption
\item
  Productivity improvement due to efficient / easy data visualization
\item
  Gradual development of fail fast mentality

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fast changes / hacks / tryouts can be reverted easily
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Growing legitimation for (costly) Analytics Services adoption efforts
\end{itemize}
